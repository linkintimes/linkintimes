- 👋 Hi, I’m @linkintimes
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and graphics along with programming in general!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, C/C++ (good luck...), and Rust. I also like to practice art and piano in my free time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and anything that'll help me learn more about programming.
- 📫 Here's how to reach me ab28814@sersd.org
